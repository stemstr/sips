`draft` `author:michaelhall923` `author:bndw` `author:samsamskies`

The purpose of this SIP is to define kind for music tracks. 

## Event format

This SIP specifies the use of the `1808` event type, having in `content` a comment or description of the track, and a list of tags described below:

* `download_url` the url to download the file.
* `stream_url` the url to stream the file.
* `x` SHA-256 hash of the file at `download_url`
* `waveform` a stringified int[] (any length) of the waveform data, used for visualization of the track.

```json

  "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the the serialized event data>,
  "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
  "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
